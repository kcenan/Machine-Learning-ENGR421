# Machine-Learning-ENGR421

Machine Learning class project @ Koc University

Course include a broad introduction to machine learning covering regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods; supervised and unsupervised models; linear and nonlinear models; parametric and nonparametric models; combinations of multiple models; comparisons of multiple models and model selection.

Projects:
- Implement a naïve Bayes’ classifier in Python
- Implement a discrimination by regression algorithm for multiclass classification in Python.
- Implement a multilayer perceptron for multiclass discrimination in R, Matlab, or Python.
- Implement a decision tree regression algorithm in Python.
- Develop a machine learning solution in Python for a real-life regression problem from finance industry. Machine learning algorithm needs to predict the number of cash withdrawals from 47 different ATMs of a bank using the information given about each ATM and the withdrawal date. 
- Develop a machine learning solution in Python for six real-life classification problems from finance industry. Machine learning algorithm needs to predict whether a credit card customer will take specific actions (six different scenarios named as TARGET_1, TARGET_2, TARGET_3, TARGET_4, TARGET_5, and TARGET_6) using the information given about each customer.
